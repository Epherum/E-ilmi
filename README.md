# E-ILIMI

## Demo of this app:

![demo](./src/e-ilimi.gif)

### Or Go to the live site and try it for yourself [here](https://e-ilmii.netlify.app/)

## What is this project about?

- This is an e-commerce app that allows shoppers to view books provided by the company or by the user.
- The user can upgrade to a seller and post his own books.
- This serves as a React, three.js, and Framer Motion learning project.
- The backend is done by another classmate, and was taken down with heroku ending the free tier so the books are placeholders.

## What technologies were used?

- react.js (create-react-app)

### Styling:

- SASS
- CSS (no premade components libraries)

### Routing:

- react-router

### Hosting

- Netlify

## What can be further improved?

1. the entire dom is react-three-fiber canvas, so everything is 3d, all the elements are positioned absolute.
  the design is unscalable, unresponsive, clunky, the 3d library wasen't a good choice

2. everything, burn it to the ground, i made every single wrong decision while coding this, and only had a month to make it. atleast it looks good

## How can you clone and tweak this project?

1.Don't

2.From your command line, first clone this repo:

```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Epherum/E-ilmi.git

$ cd E-ilmi

```

Then you can install the dependencies using NPM:

Miserable coding!
